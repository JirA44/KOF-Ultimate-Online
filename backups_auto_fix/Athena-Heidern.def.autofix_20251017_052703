;<changing commend pattern and rule of 'C' version>

;This character has same skills but it's commend pattern divided into 3.
;If anyone wants to use original, it's fine.
;for original, changing into Athena's commend is changing 'cmd = athena_heidern_n.cmd' into 'cmd = athena_heidern_a.cmd' at the top.
;for original, changing into heidern's commend is changing 'cmd = athena_heidern_n.cmd' into 'cmd = athena_heidern_h.cmd' at the top.
;it's just different in commend pattern.

;This character has normal version and bust morphing version.
;anyone wants to use normal version can use it
;by changing 'cns = athena_heidern.cns' and 'cns = athena_heidern_b.cns' on top into 'st  = athena_heidern.cns' and 'st  = athena_heidern_b.cns'.
;it's only effects on victory position, but anything else.
